		Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed
		through some interesting places on the way: 
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Walla Walla, WA, </li>
		<li>Magic City, ID, </li>
		<li>Bountiful, UT, </li>
		<li>Last Chance, CO,</li>
		<li>Why, AZ </li>
		<li>Truth or Consequences, NM.</li>
	</ol>

		I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the 
		road today: 
	</p>
		<blockquote>
			Passing cars, <br>
			When you can't see, <br>
			May get you, <br>
			A glimpse, <br>
			Of etermity. <br>
		</blockquote>
	<p>
		I definitely won't be passing any cars.
	</p>

	<p>
		My first day of the trip!  I can't believe I finally got
		everything packed and ready to go.  Because I'm on a Segway,
		I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me: 
	</p>
		<ul>
			<li>cellphone </li>
			<li>iPod</li>
			<li>digital camera</li>
			<li>a protein bar</li>
		</ul>
	<p>
		Just the essentials.  As 
		Lao Tzu would have said, <q>A journey of a thousand miles begins
		with one Segway</q>.
