			<P><SPAN class="initial">T</SPAN>he Iraqi government is "anxious to get <A HREF="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=saddam+hussein">Saddam's</A> execution done" and that it is likely to be carried out before the New Year — 
				perhaps even within the next 24 hours, a U.S. military official told FOX News.  
			</P>
			<P>
				This official said American forces are now in the process of finalizing the former Iraqi dictator's transfer to Iraqi custody and to the location where he would be executed. 
				Several U.S. officials said they are not ruling out the possibility that <A HREF="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=saddam+hussein">Saddam</A> will be put to death as early as Friday.
			</p>	
			<P>
				<SPAN class="maroon">Iraq's highest court</SPAN> on Tuesday rejected <A HREF="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=saddam+hussein">Saddam's</A> appeal against his conviction and death sentence for the 
				killing of 148 Shiites in the northern city of Dujail in 1982. The court said the former dictator should be hanged within 30 days.
			</P>
			<P> The startling news that the execution could come before 2007 came on the same day <A HREF="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=saddam+hussein">Saddam's</A> chief lawyer implored 
				world leaders to intervene saying <A HREF="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=saddam+hussein">Saddam</A> should enjoy protection from his enemies as a "prisoner of war."
			</P>
			<P> "According to the international conventions, it is forbidden to hand a prisoner of war to his adversary," <A HREF="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=saddam+hussein">Saddam's</A> lawyer Khalil al-Dulaimi said.
			</P>
			<P> "I urge all the international and legal organizations, the United Nations secretary-general, the Arab League and all 
				the leaders of the world to rapidly prevent the American administration from handing the president to the Iraqi authorities," 
				he told The Associated Press

			</P>
			<P> <CITE>Cardinal Renato Martino</CITE>, <CITE>Pope Benedict XVI's</CITE> top prelate for <DFN>justice</DFN> issues and a former Vatican envoy to the U.N., 
				condemned the death sentence in a newspaper interview published Thursday, saying capital punishment goes against the teachings of 
				the Roman Catholic Church.
			</P> 
			<P>	After <A HREF="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=saddam+hussein">Saddam's</A> death sentence was handed down last month, Louise Arbour, the U.N. high commissioner for human rights, urged 
				Iraq to ensure a fair appeals process and to refrain from executing <A HREF="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=saddam+hussein">Saddam</A> even if the sentence is upheld
			</P> 
			<P> Some international legal observers and human rights groups have also called <A HREF="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=saddam+hussein">Saddam's</A> trial unfair because of alleged 
				interference by the Shiite-dominated government. There has also been internal debate among Iraqis about legal procedures 
				surrounding the timeframe and whether the presidency is required to approve the execution.
