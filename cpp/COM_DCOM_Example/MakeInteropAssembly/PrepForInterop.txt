These commands must be run..


You must make an SNK file for the strong name required by the interop import tool

Command:

(for example)
sn -k COM_DCOM_ExSimple.snk

This makes a random key pair and places it in the .snk file shown.

The command for creating the interop assembly is:

tlbimp COM_DCOM_Example_Simple.tlb /primary /keyfile:COM_DCOM_ExSimple.snk /out:COM_DCOM_Example_Simple_Interop.dll

the /out parameter is the assembly we are creating..
