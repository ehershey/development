AppWizard has created the following resources:

PageFlipperPg311.rc
    This is a listing of all of the Microsoft Windows resources that the
    program uses.  It includes the icons, bitmaps, and cursors that are stored
    in the RES subdirectory.  This file can be directly edited in Microsoft

    Microsoft Visual C++ reads and updates this file.

    This icon is included by the main resource file PageFlipperPg311.rc.

    of the application's icon. This icon is included by the main resource
    file PageFlipperPg311.rc.

StdAfx.h, StdAfx.cpp
    These files are used to build a precompiled header (PCH) file
