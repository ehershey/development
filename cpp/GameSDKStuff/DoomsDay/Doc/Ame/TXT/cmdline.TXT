========================================================================
1. GENERAL OPTIONS

 Option           Abbr.   Description
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 @filename                Response file. The given file is read and
                          its contents are inserted to the command
                          line, replacing the option itself. E.g.
                          "@args.rsp".

 --                       Stop processing options. Anything after
                          this is discarded. Useful in response files.

 -verbose         -v      Be more verbose with console messages. Two
                          "-verbose" options gives even more messages
                          (e.g. "-v -v").

 -userdir P       -ud     Sets the working directory. By default the
                          engine uses the current working directory
                          (the one in which it was started). Relative
                          paths in "-game" and "-gl" are not affected.

 -basedir P       -bd     Defines a custom base directory that will
                          be prepended to some relative paths
                          (default fonts path, model search paths,
                          default DED file paths, default WAD file
                          paths). E.g. the standard distribution uses
                          "-basedir ..\..", which is the relative
                          path from the runtime folders to the
                          Doomsday root folder.

 -stdbasedir      -sbd    Use the standard base directory (..\..).

 -savedir P               Changes the directory where savegames will
                          be placed. The default is savegame.

 -out F                   Redirects output to the given file. By
                          default all messages are printed to
                          Doomsday.out.

 -file F          -f      Loads in the given WAD file as a startup
                          WAD (i.e. it can't be unloaded with the
                          unload command). You can give more than one
                          WAD file as the parameter. An alternative
                          to "-file" is "-iwad", which works in the
                          same way.

 -game F          -g      Specifies the game DLL to use (required).
                          This must either be just the file name
                          (jDoom.dll) or the full path to the DLL
                          (C:\Doomsday\Bin\jDoom.dll).

 -maxzone N       -mem    Specify how much memory will be allocated
                          for the game (N bytes). E.g. to allocate 32
                          Mbs:

                              -maxzone 32m

 -playdemo F              After initialization loads the given demo
                          file F (which resides in the Demo
                          subdirectory), plays it and then quits.

 -timedemo F              After initialization loads the given demo
                          file F (which resides in the Demo
                          subdirectory), plays it in singletics mode
                          (i.e. as fast as possible), displays frame
                          count information and quits.

 -nowsk                   Disable Windows system keys (Alt-Tab etc).

 -nomouse                 Don't initialize mouse.

 -nojoy                   Don't initialize joystick.

========================================================================
2. CONFIGURATION OPTIONS

 Option           Abbr.   Description
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 -config F        -cfg    Specifies the CFG file to use (for example
                          jDoom.cfg). When the game is quit, console
                          variable values and key bindings are
                          written to this file.

 -parse F         -p      After initialization reads the given file
                          and executes the commands in it (by
                          treating each read line as a console
                          command). You can give more than one file
                          as the parameter.

 -cparse F        -cp     Same as "-parse", but executes the commands
                          before anything is initialized (right after
                          console variable values have been read from
                          the default config file). You can give more
                          than one file as the parameter.

 -command S       -cmd    After initialization executes the console
                          command "S". Note that if the command
                          includes whitespace characters it must be
                          quoted. E.g. to execute the command:

                              echo "Hello world."

                          you must use the option:

                              -command "echo ""Hello world."""

                          More than one command can be given as a
                          parameter, either as separate command line
                          options ("-cmd S S S") or separate console
                          commands ("-cmd "S; S; S"").

========================================================================
3. DED OPTIONS

 Option           Abbr.   Description
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 -def F                   Additional Doomsday Engine Definition files
                          to read. The specified files are read in
                          addition to the default DED files.

 -defs F          -d      Specifies the Doomsday Engine Definition
                          files to read. You can give more than one
                          DED file as the parameter. When using this
                          option you must give the name of the
                          primary DED file first (for example
                          jDoom.ded).

========================================================================
4. MULTIPLAYER OPTIONS

........................................................................
4.1 Options for a server

 Option           Abbr.   Description
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 -dedicated               Run in dedicated mode. No graphics or
                          sounds will be initialized. The game will
                          run in a text mode console.

 -server                  Start running in server mode right after
                          startup, using TCP/IP as the network
                          protocol.

........................................................................
4.2 Options for a client

 Option           Abbr.   Description
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 -connect IP              Connect to a server running at the
                          specified IP address immediately after
                          startup, using TCP/IP. For example:
                          "-connect 127.0.0.1". The port to use can
                          be included: "-connect 127.0.0.1:12345".

========================================================================
5. GRAPHICS OPTIONS

                          be just the file name (drD3D.dll) or the
                          full path to the DLL
                          (C:\Doomsday\Bin\drD3D.dll).

 -bpp N           -b      Specify the color depth to use. Defaults to
                          desktop color depth. E.g. "-bpp 32"

 -refresh N               Specify the refresh rate to use in
                          fullscreen mode. Defaults to the current
                          display refresh rate. E.g. "-refresh 75"

 -window          -wnd    Start the game in a window. By default the
                          game runs in fullscreen mode.

 -width N         -w      Game window width or horizontal display
                          resolution. The default value for this is
                          taken from the vid-res-x console variable.

 -height N        -h      Game window height or vertical display
                          resolution. The default value for this is
                          taken from the vid-res-y console variable.

 -winsize N N     -wh     Game window width and height or display
                          resolution.

                          centered on screen.

 -modeldir P      -md     Uses the given search path instead of the
                          one specified in the primary DED file.

 -fontdir P       -fd     Looks in the given directory P for the font
                          files. Defaults to Data\Fonts\.

 -gdifonts                Use Windows' GDI fonts instead of the DFNs.

 -novideo                 Don't initialize video.

 -noramp                  Don't use hardware color settings (gamma,
                          contrast, brightness).

 -leaveramp               At shutdown, don't reset color settings
                          (gamma, contrast, brightness) back to the
                          original values.

 -gfxdir P                Sets the directory where Doomsday graphics
                          resources are loaded. Defaults to

5.1 Textures

 Option           Abbr.   Description
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 -outlines                All letters, sprites, etc. will have black
                          outlines.

 -bigmtex                 If a masked texture has taller patches than
                          the texture's height, the engine will
                          resize the texture so that the largest
                          patch will fit.

 -anifilter       -ani    Use anisotropic texture filtering.

 -paltex          -ptx    Use paletted textures (if supported by the
                          hardware).

 -maxtex N                Set maximum texture size to N x N. E.g.
                          "-maxtex 128" sets the maximum size to 128
                          x 128 pixels.

 -pwadtex                 Allow using external resources with
                          textures/flats whose data is read from a
                          PWAD. By default, external resources are
                          only used with textures from an IWAD.

 -nohightex               Disable high-resolution (external) textures
                          and flats.

 -nohighpat               Disable high-resolution (external) patches
                          and sprites.

 -texdir P        -td     Loads all high-resolution (PNG, TGA, PCX)
                          textures from the given directory P.
                          Defaults to Data\<Game>\Textures.

 -texdir2 P       -td2    Secondary high-resolution (PNG, TGA, PCX)
                          texture directory. This directory is
                          checked first, so it can be used to
                          override textures in the normal texture
                          directory ("-texdir").

 -patdir P                Sets the directory where external resources
                          for patches are loaded. Defaults to
                          Data\<Game>\Patches.

 -patdir2 P               Secondary directory for searching external
                          resources for patches. This is checked
                          first, so it can be used for overriding
                          resources in the normal Patches directory.

 -lmdir P                 Sets the directory where light map
                          resources are loaded. Defaults to
                          Data\<Game>\LightMaps.

 -lmdir2 P                Secondary directory for light maps
                          resources. This is checked first, so it can
                          be used for overriding resources in the
                          normal LightMaps directory.

........................................................................
5.2 OpenGL renderer

 Option           Abbr.   Description
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 -vtxar                   Use vertex arrays. Vertex arrays are
                          usually enabled by default.

 -novtxar                 Disable vertex arrays. Try this when
                          experiencing rendering errors.

 -texcomp                 Enable texture compression (if supported by
                          the OpenGL driver). Compression is disabled
                          by default.

 -nosgm                   Disable the SGIS_generate_mipmap extension.
                          Try this when experiencing texture errors.

 -allowsoftware           Allow using the software renderer if no 3D
                          hardware acceleration is detected (or
                          reported by Windows).

 -dumptextures            Debug: Writes Targa images out of all the
                          textures that are loaded (mipmap level
                          zero).

........................................................................
5.3 Direct3D renderer

 Option           Abbr.   Description
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 -d3dcfg                  Display the Direct3D configuration dialog.
                          The dialog is otherwise only shown if Ctrl,
                          Shift or Alt is held down when the game is
                          started.

 -triple                  Enable triple buffering.

 -texbits N               Set texture bit depth. Won't affect the
                          default configuration in drD3D.ini.

 -zbits N                 Set Z buffer bit depth. Won't affect the
                          default configuration in drD3D.ini.

 -badtexalpha             Use as few bytes for texture alpha data as
                          possible (with 16 bit textures causes that
                          only one bit is used for the alpha data).

 -nodither                Disable dithering.

 -diag                    Print lots of extra information about
                          Direct3D initialization.

========================================================================
6. SOUND OPTIONS

 Option           Abbr.   Description
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 -csd                     Use dsCompat.dll, the DirectSound 6 sound
                          driver.

 -dummy                   Use the Dummy sound driver (does nothing).

 -sfxchan N               Set the number of sound channels. 16 is the
                          default.

 -musdir P                Same as "-patdir" but for music resources.

 -musdir2 P               Same as "-patdir2" but for music resources.

 -sfxdir P                Same as "-patdir" but for sound effect
                          resources.

 -sfxdir2 P               Same as "-patdir2" but for sound effect
                          resources.

 -mdvol                   Multiply the volume of all MIDI notes by
                          two. The volume is still capped to the MIDI
                          maximum of 127, though.

 -eaxignore               Ignore any errors that occur with EAX.

 -nopsf                   Do not set the primary sound buffer format.
